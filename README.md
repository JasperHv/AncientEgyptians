# ⚖️ Pharaoh's Reign
*A Reigns-style decision game set in Ancient Egypt*

## 🏺 Overview
**Pharaoh's Reign** is a choice-driven narrative game inspired by *Reigns*, where you step into the sandals of legendary rulers **Tutankhamun** or **Cleopatra**. Rule over Ancient Egypt with wisdom—or face a swift downfall.

Swipe your way through political intrigue, divine prophecies, military campaigns, and peasant uprisings. Every decision affects the delicate balance between the **Priests**, **Nobles**, **Farmers**, and **Military**. Keep them in check, or your reign may end in betrayal, revolt… or a mummy’s curse.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- **Swipe Left or Right**: Make binary decisions in response to advisors or events.
- **Balance Four Factions**:
    - 🛕 **Priests**: Keep the gods appeased.
    - 🏛️ **Nobles**: Maintain elite support and political stability.
    - 🌾 **Farmers**: Ensure the land is fertile and the people are fed.
    - ⚔️ **Military**: Defend Egypt’s borders—and your throne.

Let any faction gain too much power—or lose too much—and your rule comes to an untimely end.

## 👑 Playable Rulers
- **Tutankhamun**: A young pharaoh navigating a court full of scheming elders and spiritual upheaval.
- **Cleopatra**: A charismatic queen balancing diplomacy, love, and the looming shadow of Rome.

Each ruler has unique storylines, events, and challenges based on their historical legacies.
